## How to Use Sparkly

### How It Works

If you want to start by understanding the conceptual working of Sparkly, then read the following [technical report](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~anhai/papers1/sparkly-tr22.pdf) (a [shorter version](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~anhai/papers1/sparkly-vldb2023.pdf) of which appears in the VLDB-2023 conference). We recommend reading Section 1, Section 2, and Section 3.3 (and quickly scan the other sections if you are interested). 

You can also quickly scan the [pptx slides](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~anhai/papers1/sparkly-talk-vldb2023.pptx) of the Sparkly talk at VLDB-2023. Slides 5-8 describe how Sparkly works.

### Tutorial and Examples

Here's a tutorial written by Dev Ahluwalia in case you want a step-by-step guide of using Sparkly, and here are multiple Jupyter Notebooks showing [examples of running Sparkly](https://github.com/anhaidgroup/sparkly/tree/docs-update/examples).
