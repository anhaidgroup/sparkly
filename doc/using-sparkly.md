## How to Use Sparkly

### How It Works

If you want to start by understanding the conceptual working of Sparkly, then read the following [technical report](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~anhai/papers1/sparkly-tr22.pdf) (a [shorter version](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~anhai/papers1/sparkly-vldb2023.pdf) of which appears in the VLDB-2023 conference). We recommend reading only Section 1, Section 2, and Section 3.3 (and quickly scan the other sections if you are interested).

You can also quickly scan the [pptx slides](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~anhai/papers1/sparkly-talk-vldb2023.pptx) of the Sparkly talk at VLDB-2023. Slides 5-8 describe how Sparkly works.

### Tutorial and Examples

Here's a [tutorial](https://github.com/anhaidgroup/sparkly/blob/main/doc/sparkly-tutorial.pdf) written by Dev Ahluwalia in case you want a step-by-step guide of using Sparkly, and here are multiple [examples of running Sparkly](https://github.com/anhaidgroup/sparkly/tree/main/examples).

We strongly recommend reading the tutorial first, then check out the examples. But if you are impatient, then you can also jump directly to trying to run the examples.

When trying to run Sparkly on a cluster of machines, you should also read this [short note](https://github.com/anhaidgroup/sparkly/blob/main/doc/note-on-input-sparkly-delex.md) about the location of the input for Sparkly.
